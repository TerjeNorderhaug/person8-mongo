## Deploy with Docker

Start a local web server in a Docker container:

    docker-compose up release

Access http://localhost:5000 from a browser.

## Run Locally

Requirements: leiningen, heroku, npm

To start a server on your own computer:

    lein do clean, deps, compile
    heroku local web

Point your browser to the displayed local port.
Click on the displayed text to refresh.

## Deploy to Heroku

To start a server on Heroku:

    heroku apps:create
    git push heroku master
    heroku open

This will open the site in your browser.

## Development Workflow

Start figwheel for interactive development with
automatic builds and code loading:

    lein figwheel app server

Wait until Figwheel is ready to connect, then
start a server in another terminal:

    lein run

Open the displayed URL in a browser.
Figwheel will push code changes to the app and server.

Alternatively, to set the local environment from a .env file, start the server with:

    heroku local web

To test the system, execute:

    lein test
